    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dynamic, single-page dashboard designed for effective analysis. The structure includes: 1) A header with summary statistics and a donut chart for subject-wise question distribution, providing an immediate high-level overview. 2) A navigation bar with subject filters to allow users to focus on specific areas. 3) An interactive question grid where each question is a card with options always visible. This structure was chosen to transform the linear PDF into an explorable, non-linear tool, making it easy for aspirants to drill down into subjects and specific questions without being overwhelmed, thus enhancing usability and targeted revision. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Subject Distribution: Goal is to inform and compare. A Donut Chart (Chart.js) is used for its effectiveness in showing part-to-whole relationships. Interaction includes tooltips on hover.
        - Question Display: Goal is to organize and inform. Interactive cards (HTML/CSS) are used. Options are always visible. Interaction involves clicking an option to see the answer and explanation, which enhances self-assessment.
        - Filtering: Goal is to organize. Filter buttons update the displayed questions via JavaScript, allowing for focused study.
        - This design provides a multi-faceted view of the paper, catering to both broad analysis and detailed review, fully supporting the designed application structure.
