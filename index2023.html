    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dynamic, single-page dashboard designed for effective analysis. The structure includes: 1) A header with summary statistics and a donut chart for subject-wise question distribution, providing an immediate high-level overview. 2) A navigation bar with subject filters to allow users to focus on specific areas. 3) An interactive question grid where each question is a card with options always visible. This structure was chosen to transform the linear PDF into an explorable, non-linear tool, making it easy for aspirants to drill down into subjects and specific questions without being overwhelmed, thus enhancing usability and targeted revision. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Subject Distribution: Goal is to inform and compare. A Donut Chart (Chart.js) is used for its effectiveness in showing part-to-whole relationships. Interaction includes tooltips on hover.
        - Question Display: Goal is to organize and inform. Interactive cards (HTML/CSS) are used. Options are always visible. Interaction involves clicking an option to see the answer and explanation, which enhances self-assessment.
        - Filtering: Goal is to organize. Filter buttons update the displayed questions via JavaScript, allowing for focused study.
        - This design provides a multi-faceted view of the paper, catering to both broad analysis and detailed review, fully supporting the designed application structure.

Meandering of Gandak River formed Kanwar Lake.<br>How many of the statements given above are correct?', options: ['(a) Only one', '(b) Only two', '(c) All three', '(d) None'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'The Jhelum River does pass through Wular Lake, a major freshwater lake in Kashmir (Statement 1 is correct). Kolleru Lake is fed by seasonal rivers Budameru and Tamileru, not directly by the Krishna River (Statement 2 is incorrect). Kanwar Lake was formed by the meandering of the Burhi Gandak river, not the Gandak (Statement 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only one statement is correct.' },

Mundra Port is the largest privately owned port in India (Pair 2 is correct). Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) is the largest container port in India, not Visakhapatnam (Pair 3 is incorrect).

The average productivity per hectare in Indian agriculture is higher than that in China.<br>How many of the above statements are correct?', options: ['(a) Only one', '(b) Only two', '(c) All three', '(d) None'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'India has about 156 million hectares of arable land, which is more than China\'s 120 million hectares (Statement 1 is correct). The proportion of irrigated area in India (about 48%) is higher than in China (about 41%) (Statement 2 is incorrect). However, China\'s average agricultural productivity per hectare is significantly higher than India\'s, due to more intensive farming practices (Statement 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only one statement is correct.' },

Statement II is incorrect; nuclear power reactors typically use low-enriched uranium (LEU) with a U-235 concentration of about 3-5%. Uranium enriched to 60% is highly enriched and not required for commercial power generation.' },

The Sambar Deer is also largely nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk). The Lion-tailed Macaque, however, is diurnal (active during the day). Therefore, two of the listed animals are generally nocturnal.' },

They are well-known for caching (storing) food like nuts and seeds in the ground (2 is correct). While primarily herbivores, many squirrels are opportunistic omnivores and may eat insects or eggs (3 is correct). Therefore, two statements are correct.' },

Statement II is correct; the SARFAESI Act was amended to include InvITs in the definition of "borrower," allowing them to be part of the securitization process.' },
            { id: 22, subject: 'Current Affairs', question: 'Q22.

Statement II is also correct and explains why they are a powerful tool; by forcing private companies to pay for their emissions (either through taxes or by buying permits from the government or other entities), these markets effectively transfer resources from polluters (private sector) to the state or to entities that are reducing emissions, thereby funding climate action.' },
            { id: 24, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q24. Which one of the following activities of the Reserve Bank of India is considered to be part of \'sterilization\'?', options: ['(a) Conducting \'Open Market Operations\'', '(b) Oversight of settlement and payment systems', '(c) Debt and cash management for the Central and State Governments', '(d) Regulating the functions of Non-banking Financial Institutions'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'Sterilization refers to the RBI\'s process of neutralizing the impact of foreign exchange inflows or outflows on the domestic money supply.

Stock Market<br>How many of the above are included in capital markets?', options: ['(a) Only one', '(b) Only two', '(c) Only three', '(d) All four'], answer: 'b', explanation: 'Capital markets are for long-term funds. The Government Bond Market (for long-term bonds) and the Stock Market are part of the capital market. The Call Money Market (inter-bank short-term lending) and Treasury Bill Market (short-term government borrowing) are part of the money market. Therefore, only two are included in capital markets.' },

Mailing list of clients<br>How many of the above are considered intangible investments?', options: ['(a) Only one', '(b) Only two', '(c) Only three', '(d) All four'], answer: 'c', explanation: 'Intangible assets are non-physical assets. Brand recognition, intellectual property (like patents and copyrights), and a mailing list of clients are all intangible. Inventory, which consists of physical goods, is a tangible asset. Therefore, three of the assets are intangible.' },
