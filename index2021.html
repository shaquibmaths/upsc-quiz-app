            { id: 1, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q1. Consider the following statements:<br>1. The Governor of the Reserve bank of India (RBI) is appointed by the Central Government.<br>2. Certain provisions in the Constitution of India give the Central Government the right to issue directions to the RBI in public interest.<br>3. The Governor of the RBI draws his power from the RBI Act.<br>Which of the above statements are correct?', options: ['(a) 1 and 2 only', '(b) 2 and 3 only', '(c) 1 and 3 only', '(d) 1, 2 and 3'], answer: 'c', explanation: 'The Governor of RBI is appointed by the Central Government under the RBI Act, 1934 (Statement 1 is correct). The power for the Central Government to issue directions to the RBI is in Section 7 of the RBI Act, not the Constitution (Statement 2 is incorrect). The Governor\'s powers are derived from the RBI Act (Statement 3 is correct).' },
            { id: 2, subject: 'Current Affairs', question: 'Q2. With reference to casual workers employed in India, consider the following statements:<br>1. All casual workers are entitled for Employees Provident Fund coverage.<br>2. All casual workers are entitled for regular working hours and overtime payment.<br>3. The government can by a notification specify that an establishment or industry shall pay wages only through its bank account.<br>Which of the above statements are correct?', options: ['(a) 1 and 2 only', '(b) 2 and 3 only', '(c) 1 and 3 only', '(d) 1, 2 and 3'], answer: 'd', explanation: 'Supreme Court rulings and the Code on Social Security, 2020, have affirmed that casual workers are entitled to EPF benefits (1). The Code on Wages, 2020, provides for regular working hours and overtime (2). The Payment of Wages Act, as amended, allows the government to mandate wage payments through bank accounts (3). All statements are correct.' },
            { id: 3, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q3. Which among the following steps is most likely to be taken at the time of an economic recession?', options: ['(a) Cut in tax rates accompanied by increase in interest rate', '(b) Increase in expenditure on public projects', '(c) Increase in tax rates accompanied by reduction of interest rate.', '(d) Reduction of expenditure on public projects'], answer: 'b', explanation: 'During a recession, the government typically employs expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Increasing expenditure on public projects injects money into the economy, creates jobs, and boosts demand, which helps counter the recession.' },
            { id: 4, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q4. Other things remaining unchanged, market demand for a good might increase if<br>1. price of its substitute increases<br>2. price of its complement increases<br>3. the good is an inferior good and income of the consumers increases<br>4. its price falls<br>Which of the above statements are correct?', options: ['(a) 1 and 4 only', '(b) 2, 3 and 4', '(c) 1, 3 and 4', '(d) 1, 2 and 3'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'Demand for a good increases if the price of its substitute rises (consumers switch to the cheaper good) (1) or if its own price falls (Law of Demand) (4). Demand decreases if the price of a complement rises (2) or if consumer income rises for an inferior good (3).' },

They are supervised and regulated by local boards set up by the State Governments.<br>2. They can issue equity shares and preference shares.<br>3. They were brought under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 through an Amendment in 1966.<br>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?', options: ['(a) 1 only', '(b) 2 and 3 only', '(c) 1 and 3 only', '(d) 1, 2 and 3'], answer: 'b', explanation: 'UCBs are under the dual control of the RBI and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, not local boards (1 is incorrect). Recent RBI guidelines allow them to issue equity and preference shares (2 is correct). They were brought under the BR Act in 1966 (3 is correct).' },
            { id: 6, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q6. Indian Government Bond Yields are influenced by which of the following?<br>1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve<br>2. Actions of the Reserve bank of India<br>3. Inflation and short-term interest rates<br>Select the correct answer using the code given below.', options: ['(a) 1 and 2 only', '(b) 2 only', '(c) 3 only', '(d) 1, 2 and 3'], answer: 'd', explanation: 'Bond yields are affected by all three. US Fed actions influence foreign capital flows (1). RBI\'s monetary policy directly impacts liquidity and interest rates (2). Inflation and short-term rates affect the real return on bonds, influencing their demand and yield (3).' },
            { id: 7, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q7. Consider the following:<br>1. Foreign currency convertible bonds<br>2. Foreign institutional investment with certain conditions<br>3. Global depository receipts<br>4. Non-resident external deposits<br>Which of the above can be included in Foreign Direct Investments?', options: ['(a) 1, 2 and 3', '(b) 3 only', '(c) 2 and 4', '(d) 1 and 4'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can include instruments like FCCBs and GDRs, as well as FII under specific conditions. Non-resident external deposits are considered debt-creating flows, not FDI.' },
            { id: 8, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q8. The effect of devaluation of a currency is that it necessarily<br>1. improves the competitiveness of the domestic exports in the foreign markets.<br>2. increases the foreign value of domestic currency<br>3. improves the trade balance<br>Which of the above statements is/are correct?', options: ['(a) 1 only', '(b) 1 and 2', '(c) 3 only', '(d) 2 and 3'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'Devaluation makes a country\'s exports cheaper and thus more competitive in foreign markets (1 is correct). It decreases, not increases, the foreign value of the domestic currency (2 is incorrect). While it can improve the trade balance, it is not a necessary outcome, especially if imports are inelastic (like crude oil for India) (3 is not necessarily correct).' },
            { id: 9, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q9. Which one of the following effects of creation of black money in India has been the main cause of worry to the Government of India?', options: ['(a) Diversion of resources to the purchase of real estate and investment in luxury housing', '(b) Investment in unproductive activities and purchase of previous stones, jewellery, gold, etc.', '(c) Large donations to political parties and growth of regionalism', '(d) Loss of revenue to the State Exchequer due to tax evasion'], answer: 'd', explanation: 'While black money leads to unproductive investments and other issues, the primary and most direct cause of worry for the government is the loss of revenue to the State Exchequer. Tax evasion erodes the government\'s ability to fund public services and development.' },
            { id: 10, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q10. Which one of the following is likely to be the most inflationary in its effects?', options: ['(a) Repayment of public debt', '(b) Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit', '(c) Borrowing from the banks to finance a budget deficit', '(d) Creation of new money to finance a budget deficit'], answer: 'd', explanation: 'Creating new money (also known as monetizing the deficit or printing money) directly increases the money supply in the economy without a corresponding increase in goods and services. This is the most inflationary option as it represents "too much money chasing too few goods".' },
            { id: 11, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q11. The money multiplier in an economy increases with which one of the following?', options: ['(a) Increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio in the banks', '(b) Increase in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio in the banks', '(c) Increase in the banking habit of the people', '(d) Increase in the population of the country'], answer: 'c', explanation: 'The money multiplier is inversely related to the reserve ratio (CRR, SLR). An increase in the banking habit of people means they hold less cash and deposit more in banks. This reduces the currency-deposit ratio and increases the banks\' capacity to create credit, thus increasing the money multiplier.' },
            { id: 12, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q12. With reference to Indian economy, demand-pull inflation can be caused/increased by which of the following?<br>1. Expansionary policies<br>2. Fiscal stimulus<br>3. Inflation-indexing wages<br>4. Higher purchasing power<br>5. Rising interest rates<br>Select the correct answer using the code given below.', options: ['(a) 1, 2 and 4 only', '(b) 3, 4 and 5 only', '(c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only', '(d)1, 2, 3, 4 and 5'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'Demand-pull inflation is caused by excess demand. Expansionary policies (1), fiscal stimulus (2), and higher purchasing power (4) all increase aggregate demand. Inflation-indexing wages aims to maintain purchasing power, not increase it in real terms. Rising interest rates are a tool to curb inflation, not cause it.' },

Retail investors through demat account can invest in \'Treasury Bills\' and \'Government of India Debt Bonds\' in primary market.<br>2. The \'Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching\' is a government securities trading platform of the Reserve Bank of India.<br>3. The \'Central Depository Services Ltd\' is jointly promoted by the Reserve Bank of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange.<br>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?', options: ['(a) 1 only', '(b) 1 and 2', '(c) 3 only', '(d) 2 and 3'], answer: 'b', explanation: 'Through the RBI Retail Direct Scheme, retail investors can invest directly in T-Bills and G-Secs in the primary market (1 is correct). NDS-OM is RBI\'s trading platform for government securities (2 is correct). CDSL was promoted by the BSE, not jointly with the RBI (3 is incorrect).' },

It is not a WHO/World Bank initiative (2 is incorrect).' },
            { id: 15, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q15. In India, the central bank\'s function as the \'lender of last resort\' usually refers to which of the following?<br>1.

Lending to governments to finance budgetary deficits<br>Select the correct answer using the code given below.', options: ['(a) 1 and 2', '(b) 2 only', '(c) 2 and 3', '(d) 3 only'], answer: 'b', explanation: 'The "lender of last resort" function means the central bank (RBI) provides liquidity to solvent commercial banks that are facing temporary liquidity shortages and cannot borrow from other sources. It does not extend to industry bodies directly or for financing government deficits in this context.' },
            { id: 16, subject: 'Current Affairs', question: 'Q16. \'R2 Code of Practices\' constitutes a tool available for promoting the adoption of', options: ['(a) environmentally responsible practices in electronics recycling industry', '(b) ecological management of \'Wetlands of International Importance\' under the Ramsar Convention', '(c) sustainable practices in the cultivation of agricultural crops in degraded lands.', '(d) \'Environmental Impact Assessment\' in the exploitation of natural resources'], answer: 'a', explanation: 'R2 stands for "Responsible Recycling". The R2 Code of Practices is a standard created for the electronics recycling industry to promote environmentally responsible and safe practices for managing used electronics.' },
            { id: 17, subject: 'Environment', question: 'Q17. Why is there a concern about copper smelting plants?<br>1. They may release lethal quantities of carbon monoxide into environment.<br>2.
