    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dynamic, single-page dashboard designed for effective analysis. The structure includes: 1) A header with summary statistics and a donut chart for subject-wise question distribution, providing an immediate high-level overview. 2) A navigation bar with subject filters to allow users to focus on specific areas. 3) An interactive question grid where each question is a card with options always visible. This structure was chosen to transform the linear PDF into an explorable, non-linear tool, making it easy for aspirants to drill down into subjects and specific questions without being overwhelmed, thus enhancing usability and targeted revision. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Subject Distribution: Goal is to inform and compare. A Donut Chart (Chart.js) is used for its effectiveness in showing part-to-whole relationships. Interaction includes tooltips on hover.
        - Question Display: Goal is to organize and inform. Interactive cards (HTML/CSS) are used. Options are always visible. Interaction involves clicking an option to see the answer and explanation, which enhances self-assessment.
        - Filtering: Goal is to organize. Filter buttons update the displayed questions via JavaScript, allowing for focused study.
        - This design provides a multi-faceted view of the paper, catering to both broad analysis and detailed review, fully supporting the designed application structure.

"Rapid Financing Instrument" and "Rapid Credit Facility" are related to the provisions of lending by which one of the following?', options: ['(a) Asian Development Bank', '(b) International Monetary Fund', '(c) United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative', '(d) World Bank'], answer: 'b', explanation: 'The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) are emergency lending facilities provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to member countries facing urgent balance of payments needs, without the need for a full-fledged program.' },
            { id: 2, subject: 'Economy', question: 'Q2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:<br>1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of rupee.<br>2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.<br>3.

An increase in REER means exports become more expensive, indicating a loss, not an improvement, in trade competitiveness (Statement 2 is incorrect). Higher domestic inflation causes REER to rise more than NEER, creating a divergence (Statement 3 is correct).' },

To counter rupee depreciation, RBI sells dollars to increase dollar supply (Statement 2 is correct). If foreign interest rates fall, capital flows into India, causing the rupee to appreciate. To counter this, RBI buys dollars to inject rupees (Statement 3 is correct).' },
            { id: 4, subject: 'Current Affairs', question: 'Q4. With reference to the "G20 Common Framework", consider the following statements:<br>1.

Rules state that an e-commerce marketplace entity cannot have ownership or control over inventory, and inventory of a vendor is deemed controlled if more than 25% of its purchases are from the marketplace entity or its group companies (Statement 2 is correct).' },
